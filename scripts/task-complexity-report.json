      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Infrastructure",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into subtasks covering frontend initialization, backend setup, CI/CD configuration, code quality tools, documentation, and initial deployment.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (React, TypeScript, Tailwind) and infrastructure components (CI/CD, deployment pipelines) across both frontend and backend. It requires significant initial configuration and architectural decisions that will impact the entire project."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the authentication system implementation into subtasks covering Auth0 integration, user registration/login flows, protected routes setup, session management, and user preference storage.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication involves security-critical functionality with multiple components (registration, login, session management). While using Auth0 reduces some complexity, proper integration still requires careful implementation across frontend and backend systems."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Core Chat Interface with AI Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the chat interface development into subtasks covering UI component creation, OpenAI API integration, context management, conversation modeling, message threading, error handling, and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This is a core feature with high complexity due to the combination of UI development, AI integration, and context management. It requires sophisticated state management and API handling while ensuring good performance and user experience."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Data Persistence Layer",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the data persistence implementation into subtasks covering MongoDB setup, PostgreSQL configuration, data model creation, API endpoint development, caching layer implementation, and data synchronization mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple database technologies (MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and requires careful design of data models and relationships. The addition of caching and real-time synchronization adds significant complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Message Pinning and Learning Panel",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the message pinning and learning panel feature into subtasks covering pinning UI implementation, learning panel development, data synchronization between components, and API endpoint creation.",
      "reasoning": "This feature builds on existing components but requires new UI elements and data synchronization. The complexity is moderate as it extends existing functionality rather than creating entirely new systems."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Self-Assessment Tagging System",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the self-assessment tagging system into subtasks covering UI component development, tag data structure implementation, API endpoint creation, and filtering/organization functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This feature is relatively straightforward, extending the existing pinning system with additional metadata and UI elements. The complexity is lower as it builds directly on existing components."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Text Highlighting and Branching",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the text highlighting and branching feature into subtasks covering text selection mechanism, branch creation interface, AI prompt generation, thread navigation system, context retention implementation, and conversation model updates.",
      "reasoning": "This feature has high complexity due to the technical challenges of cross-browser text selection, managing conversation branches, and maintaining context between threads. It requires significant changes to the conversation model and UI."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Diagnostic Challenges",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the diagnostic challenges feature into subtasks covering AI prompt template creation, challenge UI development, response handling implementation, integration with learning tags, and user response tracking.",
      "reasoning": "This feature requires sophisticated AI prompt engineering and integration with the existing learning system. The complexity comes from generating relevant questions and handling user responses appropriately."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Guide Generation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the guide generation feature into subtasks covering insight organization algorithm, Markdown formatting implementation, guide display UI, versioning mechanism, and database model creation.",
      "reasoning": "This feature involves complex algorithms to organize insights coherently and requires versioning capabilities. The challenge of automatically generating structured content from user-pinned insights adds significant complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Export Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the export functionality into subtasks covering Markdown conversion logic, file generation mechanism, export options UI, and API endpoint development.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward feature that builds on the existing guide generation. The main work involves format conversion and file handling, which are well-understood problems with established solutions."
